<h1>What Is Our Mission?</h1>
<p>
Our game development team aims to promote team building and encourage communication as well as exercise. <br/>
  <br/>
You might be wondering how we plan to measure the effects of our game, we will measure the impact of this game by noting how often people communicate and speak to each other. We'll also be monitoring the number of points each team earns as a result of effectice communication. Additonally, We can measure the playersâ€™ heart rates to determine whether participants are getting in some exercise. There will be a google form that our play testers will be asked to fill out, the form will include questions about how enjoyable the game was, and their heart rate before and after playing. <br/>
  <br/>
If you're curious, the survey can be taken through this link: (<a href="https://forms.gle/RDDh6EUP7kaA1uzV6">Take The 2012 Outbreak Game Survey</a>)
