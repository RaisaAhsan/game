        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Raisa Ahsan (she/her/hers), I'm a freshman in highschool and I enjoy creating things. I have some experience with coding, working with electronics, robotics, and building in a workshop. I'm very artistic and I'm a quick learner. <br/>   
            <br/>
            My current favorite game is Uno, it's a fun, interactive multiplayer game. The power cards within the deck play a crucial role in creating competition between players. The rules are relatively easy to learn and follow and the rounds aren't long and tiring.<br/> 
            <br/>
            To me, a game is an interactive activity that can be played alone or with multiple people, it typically has a goal that players target and a set of rules everyone has to abide by.<br/>
            <br/>
            I've always thought that my main gamer type was killer due to my competitiveness, and after taking the Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology [**Take The Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology**](http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/), I recieved the following results: <br/>
           
            <ol>
                <li>**87% Killer**</li>
                <li>**53% Socializer**</li>
                <li>**47% Explorer**</li>
                <li>**13% Achiever**</li>
            </ol>
