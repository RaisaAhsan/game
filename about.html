        <p>
          Hello!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Raisa Ahsan, I'm a freshman in highschool and I enjoy creating things. I have some experience with coding, working with electronics, robotics, and building in a workshop. I'm very artistic and I'm a quick learner. My current favorite game is Uno, it's a fun, interactive multiplayer game. The power cards within the deck play a crucial role in creating competition between players. The rules are relatively easy to learn and follow and the rounds aren't long and tiring.
