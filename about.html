        <p>
            <em>Welcome!ðŸ‘‹</em> My name is Raisa Ahsan <i>(she/her/hers)</i>, I'm a freshman in highschool and I enjoy creating things. I have some experience with coding, working with electronics, robotics, and building in a workshop. I'm very artistic and I'm a quick learner. <br/>   
            <br/>
            My current favorite game is Uno, it's a fun, interactive multiplayer game. The power cards within the deck play a crucial role in creating competition between players. The rules are relatively easy to learn and follow and the rounds aren't long and tiring.<br/> 
            <br/>
            To me, a game is an interactive activity that can be played alone or with multiple people, it typically has a goal that players target and a set of rules everyone has to abide by.<br/>
            <br/>
            I've always thought that my main gamer type was killer due to my competitiveness, and after taking the Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology (<a href="http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/">Take The Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology</a>), I recieved the following results: <br/>
           
            <ul>
                <li><b>87% Killer</b></li>
                <li><b>53% Socializer</b></li>
                <li><b>47% Explorer</b></li>
                <li><b>13% Achiever</b></li>
            </ul>
